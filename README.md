> A Yeoman Generator for creating websites with TypeScript, Sass, ESLint and Webpack

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-webpack-ts using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-webpack-ts
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo webpack-ts
```

The generator will prompt if you want to include the [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) service worker helper.

You can add new classes with the subgenerator

```bash
yo webpack-ts:classib another-greeter
```
