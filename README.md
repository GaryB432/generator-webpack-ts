[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/GaryB432/generator-webpack-ts.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GaryB432/generator-webpack-ts)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-webpack-ts.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-webpack-ts)

Generate a scaffold project using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-webpack-ts using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-webpack-ts
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo webpack-ts
```

The generator will prompt if you want to include the [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) service worker helper.
